packages - packages used in Archphile distribution
========

This repository contains all the PKGBUILDS used in Archphile distribution. Currently there are no special packages for
Cubox-i. For this device I am using udoo packages and then I replace /etc/mpd.conf file.

upmpdcli and shairprt will not be enabled by default!
